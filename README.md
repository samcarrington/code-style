# Jumpstart Two
Version 2 of a jumpstart scaffolding template for sites, apps and prototypes - based on the Yeoman Gulp Webapp Generator with added Jade templating

Clone, `npm install` and `bower install` to get going then `gulp serve` to test and preview, with live reload thanks to Yeoman.

Uses a slightly updated version of the Jade recipe from :
