## Introduction

This guide should be used to assist members of the engineering team
in writing good quality applications. This is intended as a
brief checklist and set of baseline standards for the team to follow. It
should be shared with development partners as the expectation for all work
contributed to projects. Adherence to standards should be
monitored and enforced by Technical Leads.

### General Principles

- Don't prematurely optimise; keep it readable, well commented and understandable
- All code in any project should smell like one person typed it
- Enforce the agreed upon styles through automation, code review and pull request
- Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation
- An [EditorConfig][editorconfig] should be added to any project to maintain conventions
- Use configuration files committed to the project repository to set up rules for
  [eslint][eslint-config] and/or [prettier][prettier-config] or an alternative
  linter/formatter such as [rome][rome]

Generally use and enforce the standards outlined here. If your project varies in
style at all from this document, agree that up front, document the standard, and
enforce the standard you're using by adding tooling to your project. Overall, it
is important to be internally consistent and predictable.
